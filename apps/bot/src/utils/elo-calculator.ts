/**
 * Universal Elo rating for the matching engine.
 *
 * The system proposes a Thursday match simultaneously to both users
 * (double-blind — no inviter / invitee). Each user's Accept/Decline is treated
 * as one independent rating "game" against the other side: A's decision moves
 * B's rating, and B's decision moves A's. So a single match resolves into two
 * independent updates, computed from each direction's own expected score.
 *
 * Outcome matrix (per the product decision matrix):
 *   - Mutual accept   → both gain
 *   - Mutual decline  → both lose
 *   - A accepts, B declines → B gains (cleared A's bar), A loses (failed B's bar)
 *
 * Dynamic K-factor — K=40 while a user has played < 10 matches (fast
 * calibration for newbies), K=20 thereafter. Each side uses its OWN
 * `eloMatchesPlayed` to pick its K, so a calibrated veteran's rating doesn't
 * jolt around when paired with a fresh user.
 *
 * Rating bounds: Elo math is unbounded, but the schema stores `eloScore` as
 * an Int defaulting to 500 with the conceptual range [0..1000]. We clamp
 * after each update so a long losing streak can't drive a rating below zero
 * or run past the league-penalty's calibrated band.

 *   - We deduct a fixed amount (no K-factor, no expected-score math).
 *   - `eloMatchesPlayed` is NOT incremented (no actual match happened
 *     from a rating-system POV).
 *   - The peer's rating is left untouched. They did their part — getting

 * Tuned small (10) so it nudges behavior without nuking new accounts.
